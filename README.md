## How Crisp are You?
The idea behind this program is that the closer you are to the UK, the more crisp you are. And the further you are from the UK, the more chip you are.

## Description
This program pulls longitude and latitude from a URL request and then calculates distance from the prime meridian, Converts distance from degrees to percentage and displays what percent away from either side of the meridian it is.
## GUI

## Dependencies/Installation
None! Other than python 3, you don't need anything to run this program. We've used Tkinter for the GUI because it comes installed by default with any standard python 3 Installation. 
You need only download the program from github and run the `main.py` program with the following command:

    python3 main.py
